Node Project Example
====================

This project is an example of building a Node application using a host of technologies which simplify the process of constructing, running and testing the application. To set up and run the application, do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Go to the cloned repository and run `npm install` in a terminal
4. To run the application, run `npm start` in a terminal
5. To run the example test, run `npm test` in a terminal

This application is an example of a project built using the following tools:

- [Dject](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dject)
- [Signet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signet)

The test is an example of how to write useful, meaningful, communicative tests using the following common tools:

- [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai)
- [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)
- [Sinon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon)

The test file also introduces using the following tools which you may not have used before:

- [Approvals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/approvals)
- [Datamother](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datamother)
- [https://www.npmjs.com/package/stubcontractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stubcontractor)

This entire project was intentionally built test-last in order to generate a set of videos on how to introduce tests after an application is already built and how to make those tests more meaningful as work continues.
